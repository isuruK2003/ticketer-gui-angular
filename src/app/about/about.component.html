    <h1>Real Time Ticket Management System</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This project is a real-time event ticketing system implementing the Producer-Consumer pattern. 
        The system simulates multiple ticket vendors (producers) releasing tickets and customers (consumers) purchasing them concurrently. 
        It uses advanced multithreading and synchronization techniques to ensure data integrity and smooth operation.
